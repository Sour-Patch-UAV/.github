### Overview

This project is an effort to develop a Distributed Control System from scratch over the Summer '23 period before my last semester of undergrad (Computer Science).

The project, named Sour, utilizes a computational approach for the design and testing of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with the goal of enhancing its flight performance and reliability through the implementation of a Distributed Control System. 
All testing, development, and design will be conducted by me and updates for software versions will be maintained via Github.

### Goals

_Goals for this project include, but are not limited to_:

- Communications software developed in Java specifically for [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html)
- Research based development for some algorithm to provide efficient, effective, and safe flight path for the UAV
- Simulation software developed in Java to test algorithms for flight path and communications flow between Teensy and Java
- Complete UML and schematics, and design visualization via report
- Video Representation of the design process and implementation
- Simplification of raw wiring between Teensy 4.0 and peripherals to custom PCB
- Development of physical UAV w/ simplified PCB and Teensy 4.0
- Presentation of final project
